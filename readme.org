* SARTA Code Readme

This repo is a new start for sarta development.  The main goal for now
is to keep things as simple as possible with a minimum of extra files,
etc.  

The initial commit was tested versus existing rtp files from all three
instruments.  For now the make_sarta is set to use the airs include
file template, but cris and iasi use a hard-coded include files.
The m140 variant of airs was used.  These are all the standard
versions of sarta we are presently using for production.
