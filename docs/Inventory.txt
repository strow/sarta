# SARTA Executable Inventory

# General workflow

Since early 2024, source and builds are made from the src_f90/
sub-directory. Prior to this the src_f77/ sub-directory was used.

In general, the fast coefficient database is created in the destination
directories detailed in the ftc_dev instructions. The file names of
individual coefficient files produced by that recipe are long and detail the
production stage. For the SARTA execs, the Makefile loads the include file:
incFTC_<long name>.f90 that includes the file name references. The practise
up to now has been to reference the sub-dir dbase/Coef/ with short names
e.g. set1.dat, which are themselves symbolic links to the long paths and file
names created by the ftc_dev.

The incFTC_<long name>.f90 is intended to provide some traceability, thus:
_prod2022Jul22_{dev,revX,reg,proto,prod} to indicate the production year,
build date and revision. In the past the 'dev' must past full validation
tests and have been tested in the rtp production environment (rtp_prod git repo)
before being renamed _prod and referenced in the rtp production.

Note the options at the top of the incFTC_<name>.f90 that turn on or off
the DEBUG and the minor gas calculations.

The SARTA Makefile should be examined, it links the incFTC.f90 to the selected
include file described above, and builds a version of SARTA with a matching
name to the include file, thus e.g. chirp_p2022jul22_dev.

Some execs have been built with only certain functionality included (beyond
the base 7-set build) e.g. chirp_feb20_base_so2_nh3_hno3, which were
use during development and are not intended for general use.

# Building the different layering versions

The standard SARTA build uses the original 101 AIRS atmospheric layering,
the version for the OCO2-PBL atmospheric layering can also be built.
Ensure that the Makefile correctly updates the symbolic link to the 
cbplev.f90 file BEFORE building.

# Build options

Check the Makefile and the child script make_sarta_* called by the Makefile
to see which build options are preferred, there are two of interest:
with debug and compilation checks on, or optimization level2 and compilation
checks off. The latter will produce the fastest exec.

Also, in relation to the build options, check that the incFTC_<name>.f90
file has the DEBUG logical set to false so that little output is written to
stdout.

The Makefiles are set up to include clear-sky and all-sky versions to be built,
Note the different source files required. At the time of writing, the PBL atmos.
layering version of the SARTA does not build without errors, as there is a
a problem with the bottom layer routines for the PBL atmos. layering. Note that
some of the all-sky version builds may still be in the src_f77 sub-directory.

# Register of Execs:

The latest builds use the HITRAN 2020 database that was available to this group
and installed in 2022, thus execs with build names including 'prod2022'
use HITRAN 2020.

Prior builds with the HITRAN 2016, were made available and installed for builds 
with names including 'prod2018'

HITRAN 2014 and earlier were built with less standard names, and include the
Scott builds from around 2008. So care should be used to work out the 
traceability from file dates and so forth. 

The intention has been to transfer final production builds and databases
to /asl/data/sarta_database/ (as of writing many symlinks appear to be broken).
and /as/packages/sarta/
