Figure documentation:

1.  iasi2009_vs_iasi2019_bias_std.pdf and iasi2009_vs_iasi2019_bias_std_sw_zoom.pdf show differences between the 2009 and 2019 (March 15) versions.  This is mostly spectroscopy differences.  These are averages over 49 * 6 profiles * 2 emissivities (unity and sea).

2.  iasi2009_vs_iasi2019_2391p5_vs_mmwat.pdf is again the differences between iasi 2009 and 2019 but only for the 2391.5 cm-1 channel, plotted versus water vapor total column.  This shows (as expected) that the dry profiles were in error in 2009 since we modified the continuum to only fit wet profiles, using an incorrect parameterization.  This new work is based on Hartmann's new N2-H2O and CO2-H2O continuum


3.  spectrum_fit_std.pdf, and spectrum_fit_bias.pdf are the fitting standard deviations and biases.  You can see that we are not doing quite as well as the 2009 RTA, but we do not know for sure what exactly was used (profile set) for the 2009 bias, std.  Note that the true std over a statistically representative set of profiles will be lower, since the 49 * 6 fitting profiles have extremes in them.

4.  hist_fit_bias.png and hist_fit_std.png are histograms of the fitting std's and biases.
